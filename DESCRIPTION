Author: Anne Chao, Yu-Ting Huang
Maintainer: Anne Chao <chao@stat.nthu.edu.tw>
Description: Provide simple functions to (i) calculate the order q of stability for single assemblage, (ii) calculate order q of stability and synchrony for multiple assemblages, and (iii) calculate stability of hierarchical data. This package also provide functions to plot stability (or synchrony) profile, and based on the diversity (or other) variable, analysis and plot the relationship between stability (and synchrony) and diversity (or other) variable.
